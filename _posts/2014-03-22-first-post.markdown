Right, so I'm done setting up this site. Whew. It'll be easier in the future now.
All I need to do is add my posts and do a `jekyll build` in the root directory.
Jekyll supports some nice syntax highlighting, so lucky me. 
{% highlight python linenos %}
#Hello world
#Let's write some Python
{% endhighlight %}
